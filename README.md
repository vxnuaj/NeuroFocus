# NeuroFocus

A semi-replicated project from [Ahnaaf Khan](https://ahnaafk.medium.com/creating-a-neurofeedback-program-with-python-c6153022a4e7) / [Surya Sure's](https://medium.com/@suryasure734/building-a-neurofeedback-program-to-assess-concentration-and-relaxation-25f38afc0fdd) Neurofeedback system.

A Neurofeedback System, using OpenBCIs Ganglion, to track your brain waves via EEG in order to ouput your level of FOCUS.

# Used Software
Python 3.12 
Pandas 2.1.2 
NumPy 
Matplotlib 3.8.1
BrainFlow's API

# Used Hardware
[OpenBCIs Ganglion Board](https://shop.openbci.com/products/ganglion-board) + [Headband Kit](https://fri-fl-shop.com/products/headband-kit-for-openbci)

or

You can use a synthetic board...!!!

# What you'll learn!

If you don't copy and paste this project, and you actually attempt to understand how it works, just like I did, you'll learn:

1. Basic understanding of Python
2. Basic setup and usage of Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and BrainFlow's API
3. Basic setup and usage of EEG Hardware (only if you use real hardware)

Before you dive in, let me tell you something.

From the outside this might seem difficult. But it's just a simple challenge.

I didn't know jackshit at first either. I didn't know what Pandas, NumPy, BrainFlow, or Matplotlib was.

But I spent ~5 days trying to understand and learn. And I got it.

So you can do it to.

# Here's how I understood how it worked.

1. I read these docs as I replicated the code ~ [BrainFlow](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/UserAPI.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/user/index.html#user)
2. If I didn't understand any part the code or the documentation, I asked ChatGPT to explain it to me.
3. I asked questions - [BrainFlow Slack Channel](https://brainflow.org/2020-03-23-slack/)
4. I kept learning
