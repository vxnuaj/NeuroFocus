# Used Software
Python 3.12
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and BrainFlow's API

# Used Hardware
[OpenBCIs Ganglion Board](https://shop.openbci.com/products/ganglion-board) + [Headband Kit](https://fri-fl-shop.com/products/headband-kit-for-openbci)

You can use a synthetic board...!!!

# What you'll learn

If you don't copy and paste this project, and actually attempt to understand how it works, just like I did, you'll learn:
    
    1. Basic understanding of Python
    2. Basic setup and usage of Pandas, Numpy, Matploflib, and BrainFlow's API
    3. Basic setup and usage of EEG Hardware (only if you use real hardware)
